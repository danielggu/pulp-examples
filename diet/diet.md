# Diet Mix Problem

Jimmy is a rancher. He has to feed their cows in order to ensure certain minimum nutrients intake; this requirements are 700g of protein, 28g of calcium and 150mg of vitamins. To get this purpose, he has two different foods available (*a*, *b*), each of them has a known nutrient distribution per kilogram which is included in the following table.

|       | Protein(g) | Calcium(g) | Vitamin(mg) |
| ----- | :--------: | :--------: |:-----------:|
|  *a*  |      30    |      2     |      10     |
|  *b*  |      45    |      1     |      5      |

Jimmy could feed their cows using only one of this this two foods, or maybe a mix of both. However, they have different prices (0.3 $/kg for product *a* and 0.35 $/kg for product *b*), so Jimmy wonders what is the optimal mix which minimizes the cost of feeding their cows.

Can we help Jimmy?
